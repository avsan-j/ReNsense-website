        <h1>
            Have you ever felt like a lone voyager in a vast, unfamiliar sea?
        </h1>
        <p>
            In the last 20 years, we've learned more about the brain than we have in the last 2000 years. We now know that 
            everyone can change, no matter their past experiences. This is a key statement I find very important in my own journey 
            of becoming my best version. <br><br>

            I grew up as a very curious child, full of energy (ADHD). Reading three books a day, asking all the "why" questions, 
            always active, arguing non-stop about any new idea introduced to me. I refused to conform and obey just because the 
            adults told me to. Feeling like an alien and not truly connected to anyone, I felt unloved, judged, and criticized. 
            I didn't trust anyone; my peers made fun of me. There was a lot of unaddressed anger and blame placed on me (and as 
            parents who wanted so much to improve our family life and connection, we went to therapy, where I understood that I 
            was seen as the source of the problems).<br><br>

            I'm starting to believe that all my life, I was essentially searching for inner peace and to be left alone, all the 
            while wanting to feel included and accepted, no matter what. But nothing got me there. I was too much of an outsider 
            and made it my special skill - a non-conformist by choice, a free spirit, until recently.<br><br>

            My father, with whom I rarely saw eye to eye, used to say that people are only looking under their noses. He had this 
            phrase: "Don't look for the coin underneath the streetlight." Maybe I understood it figuratively, as I tried to get as 
            far away as I could from myself (I fought cancer at a very young age), from my family (I moved to a boarding school - 
            not a fancy one), and then from the entire country (I took two suitcases and moved to Australia).<br><br>

            My main reason for all my actions was a deep-rooted feeling that I had invisible strings wrapped around me and I was 
            constantly trying to break free from them. Australia gave me the travel bug, and I started exploring the world alone, 
            fortunately meeting wonderful people and having mostly beautiful experiences, loving my newfound freedom. But I still 
            had too much energy, even though I practiced yoga twice a day, slept only three hours a night, and felt weird all the 
            time. So, I began self-medicating with weed to take the edge off.<br><br>

            In my quest to change my life and trajectory, as I got deeper into my yoga practice (I stopped meditating as it felt 
            too weird and like I wasn't good at it), I learned to breathe better and slow down. I delved into the philosophy of 
            yoga. Despite working with a coach and different therapists, I still floated on the surface. I was always afraid to 
            discover how deep this rabbit hole went. I didn't want to know that I was as bad as they had told me.<br><br>

            I stayed frustrated and impatient, particularly concerning my love life. I was so out of balance that I let almost 
            anyone who showed a bit of interest and effort get into my life (the lowest bar on earth). Most of them I didn't really 
            like, but I loved being someone's interest. I loved that someone wanted to be with me - me, whom everyone said was 
            impaired, a blemish, a blot. This became my story, my "thing." Sad, isn't it?<br><br>

            The book "The Alchemist" tells the story of a boy with a dream about a huge treasure that he ultimately finds at his 
            own home. I loved that book and read it at least four times. I believed I had reached this level of self-love and 
            forgiveness. I believed that a relationship would fix everything. It could be true if we're talking about the 
            relationship with ourselves. But I didn't know that. I loved my life and what I was doing, and loved the fact that I 
            was always chosen by my partners (remember the lowest bar?). I had a voice telling me at least someone was interested 
            in me. Someone found something good about me and was willing to love me. So, I sold myself short and the idea that I 
            wouldn't find better than that. You might think this sounds all too familiar, and you're not alone in that. I never 
            knew I held beliefs about myself that weren't in my favor. I felt I was hiding something from myself, but I was sure 
            I wasn't repeating all the negative things I heard about myself since childhood. I suppressed them - if I don't hear 
            them, they can't control me.<br><br>

            Carl Jung's saying, “Until you make the subconscious conscious, it will direct your life, and you will call it fate,” 
            resonates with me. These core beliefs dictate our life while we live under the assumption of free will. I was sure I 
            was the only one choosing my life. I didn't know how wrong I was. I tried hard to avoid my life's soundtrack without 
            awareness that I'm not even choosing. I was just reacting. I thought I was in control, with all my anger, impatience, 
            frustration, and resentment. I had so many people to point to or just agree with myself that that's how I grew up, and 
            I just needed to detach as much as possible from home.<br><br>

            I was deeply shocked when I realized how wrong I was. But I decided I had nothing better to do than invest my time in 
            understanding why I manifested some things like magic, and other things, like finding myself in wrong relationships 
            with partners I didn't even like - seeing their big red flags and ignoring them. Why did I put myself in those 
            situations? I remember the day it hit me: the understanding that I no longer wanted to fall into the deepest pit only 
            to climb out. I wanted to see it and tell myself, “Do not go there. You no longer need to prove to anyone how good you 
            are at getting out. Just stay out.” That was a defining moment in my life, helping me realize I was so busy proving 
            how good I was. Why? To whom? Who was my critic, judging me?<br><br>

            Eleanor Roosevelt once said, “No one can make you feel inferior without your consent.” From that day to this very 
            moment, I can't stop the unfolding. It's like dominoes - once you touch one, you can't stop it. And the best thing is 
            I don't even want to stop it. My life, which was already brilliant, became even better now that I am the best version 
            of myself. and I keep improving and fine tuning. <br><br>

            I have stopped wanting, chasing, and worrying. I jump from the highest points without a rope, knowing I have a strong 
            net of faith and healthy core beliefs to catch and support me. I didn't do it alone, though it may sound like it. I 
            have my close family and friends whom I call “framely.” I have my coaches and teachers. Everyone was there and allowed 
            me to get to this point. In embracing myself fully, I found the peace I had been searching for all along time.<br><br>

            I am grateful and humbled, forever thanking everyone who was part of my journey and those just joining it. I am happy 
            and blessed, and I wouldn’t want it any other way. When you're ready to embark on your own journey of self-discovery 
            and transformation, I invite you to join me in my coaching program where together, we'll unlock your full potential 
            and create a the version of you and the life that you truly love.<br><br>
