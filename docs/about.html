        <h2>Hi there!</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Dikla, and while I was born in Israel, I consider myself a global citizen. For the past 25 years, I have dedicated my life to
            supporting individuals on their personal journeys as a professional yoga instructor, certified yoga therapist, and mindset coach. At the
            age of fifteen, I successfully recovered from cancer, which solidified my understanding that my role in life is to guide people on their 
            inner journey to healing through mind and body.
            <br><br>
            I am passionate about humanity. People are the most fascinating, complex, and exciting landscapes ever created.I cherish the unique 
            symbiosis between the body, mind, and soul. I bring all this love and compassion into my sessions, along with rich and varied experience 
            in different yoga practices, meditation techniques, and mindset methods. Drawing on my extensive knowledge and intuition from teaching 
            thousands of yogis worldwide, I have created a unique blend of yoga practice and mindset coaching for deeper, harmonious, and sustainable change.
            I genuinely believe that this combination can create a powerful synergy that catalyzes significant improvements in the lives of those who desire 
            a fulfilling and peaceful life.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Why choose me?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Deep Listening: I dive deeply into your life story and craft a personalized journey just for you.</li>
            <li>Ancient Wisdom and Modern Approach: I blend ancient yoga wisdom with contemporary scientific understanding to bridge these worlds and 
                offer you the best of both
            </li>
            <li>Extensive Knowledge: Continuous training and research enable me to bring the latest innovations to our sessions.</li>
            <li>Dedication and Commitment: I am profoundly committed to your progress and development, evident in every meeting and practice.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            After many years of learning and teaching around the world, I have come to understand that there is only one thing that 
            can heal all wounds: loving yourself. Amazingly, when people start loving themselves truly and deeply, their lives improve, 
            bringing good health, abundance, profound joy, and inner peace. It's a simple premise: loving yourself. Life is a voyage of 
            self-discovery, and to be enlightened means going within, shedding light on all you discover about yourself, and loving it, 
            no matter what. That is all there is.<br><br>
            My ambition, hope, and dreams are to help everyone reach and exceed their best version of themselves. I humbly invite you to join our 
            beautiful, diverse family of clients and experience the magic of discovering your inner strength, awakening to a life full of meaning, 
            deep joy, and lasting peace.
