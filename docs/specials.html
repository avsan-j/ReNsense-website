                "I am not a healer. I don't heal anyone. Instead, I see myself as a stepping stone on the pathway to self-discovery. I create a space 
                where people can learn how incredibly wonderful they are by teaching them how to love themselves. That is my purpose. I support people, 
                helping them take charge of their lives and discover their own power, inner wisdom, and strength. I assist in removing the blocks and 
                barriers that prevent them from loving themselves, regardless of the challenges they face. Life will always present problems and 
                difficulties, but it's our reaction to them that makes a tremendous difference."" - "The power is within you" -

            After many years of learning and teaching around the world, I have come to understand that there is only one thing that can heal all 
            wounds: loving yourself. Amazingly, when people start loving themselves truly and deeply, their lives improve, bringing good health, 
            abundance, profound joy, and inner peace. It's a simple premise: loving yourself. Life is a voyage of self-discovery, and to be 
            enlightened means going within, shedding light on all you discover about yourself, and loving it, no matter what. That is all there is.<br><br>

                "The human brain is not designed for success; it's designed for survival. Survival is about conserving energy, while success is about 
                expanding energy, doing things that are uncomfortable. Success is not for average people, and if you want to achieve it, you must rewire 
                your brain. It's a neurological rewiring process, a reprogramming of your own computer. The questions that come up after making the 
                decision should receive no reaction, except for: HOW?" -

            <span style = "font-family: 'Lobster Two', sans serif; font-size: 25px; font-weight: 300">Rory Vaden</span><br><br>

            This brilliant quote summarizes the essence of mindset. Anyone in the field of life-changing coaching understands that:
            <ol type = "1">
                <li>First, you must change the way you think. Be the change you want to experience</li>
                <li>Second, you must include your body in this change through exercise, breathwork, etc. It's no surprise that these principles are central to yoga.</li>
            </ol>

            Dr. Mariel Buqué says: Once we understand that we are the only ones in charge of our own happiness, we reach ultimate freedom—the freedom 
            to create limitless possibilities. The answer to your searching is found in your feelings, not external matters. It's all within you. 
            Inside, you can merge all your desires and achieve them. Fear is an illusion, a disguise of the ego.<br><br>

            It starts here: acknowledging that you are in charge and deciding to take full responsibility for yourself in all aspects. Know that you 
            are not your thoughts, although you are the creator of them. Understand that you are the one who attaches feelings to thoughts, and 
            embrace the moment of taking full responsibility as the single best moment of your life. From now on, you will never be alone or needy. 
            You have yourself. You are the rock in your life. You can be a healthy, stable, and grounded human being, full of compassion and love. 
            It is possible to change your mind, even if it's a long road. Difficulties only show that you are getting stronger, better, and deeper.<br><br>

            Our brain is designed for survival, often making us reactive and fear-based, seeking immediate gratification and creating fight/flight 
            sensations. This doesn't allow for conscious decisions, only quick survival actions, and harbors hidden emotions. However, to achieve 
            success and profound personal growth, we need to engage the part of our brain focused on competition and future-thinking. This part helps 
            us make conscious, clear-minded decisions, viewing them as investments in our future rather than reactions to fear, triggers, and emotions.<br><br>

            By reprogramming our thoughts and actions, we can transform our lives. Our subconscious convinces us that the familiar is always better 
            than the unpredictable, even if a new approach might be better. A loving coach will challenge you to become greater without degrading you,
            and you are the most effective coach or critic for yourself. Choose to be the inspiring coach who accepts and improves yourself. Compare 
            yourself to your past self, not others, and celebrate how far you've come.
